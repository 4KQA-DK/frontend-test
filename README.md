# AKQA Frontend test
 
We will now kindly ask you to do a small test so that we can get a bit deeper into your skills as a frontend developer. 

We have created a simple design of a webpage and added it to Figma. 
 
Here is the link: https://www.figma.com/file/Eu0LK5ielUlhT4LJoXjGm3/derma-demo 

 
## The task ðŸ”¨

1. Create a simple one-page website.

2. Fork the repo and make a pull request.
 
We will clone it from Git and review your code, and in our follow-up conversation, youâ€™ll walk us through your choices and thought process. Please use any tech of your choice. 
 
The design in Figma consist of sections of content, and it is up to you to be creative and develop what you think that is needed for them. But feel free to add JavaScript functionality in any places that you think it would help.
 

## We will be looking at skills like:
 
â€¢	Tech stack. Use what youâ€™re most comfortable with (e.g. React, Vite, Tailwind, Vercel etc.)
 
â€¢	Modern JavaScript. Clear, well-structured code using ES6+ features.
 
â€¢	Semantic HTML and accessibility (e.g. can you navigate the site with keyboard only, your choice of HTML tags, semantics, ARIA attributes etc.)
 
â€¢	Component styling and responsiveness. You can use plain CSS, SCSS or a utiliy-first framework like Tailwind.
 
â€¢	Performance (maybe do a Lighthouse test)

â€¢ Deploy to a platform of your choice (e.g. Vercel, Netlify, Render etc.)
 
**We look forward to see your work and feel free to ask relevant questions regarding the task.**
